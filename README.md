# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

The management team at AutosRUsâ€™ has requested an analytical review of production data for the new MechaCar. The hope is to gain insights into production issues MechCar has been having and find solutions to create a successful product.

The key objectives of the analysis include:

 - determine variables that predict MechaCar's mpg through linear regression analysis
 - generate summary statistics on pounds per square inch (PSI) of suspension coils
 - determine if manufacturing lots are statistically different from mean population
 - design a study to compare MechaCar performance against other manufacturer vehicles
  

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Summary of Findings

1. Within the dataset, 'Vehicle Length' and 'Ground Clearance' appear to be the most significant variables that provide a non-random effect on the MechaCar's mpg values.

2. Based on the p-value of 5.35e-11, the slope of the linear model is not considered zero.  

3. The R-squared value of 0.7149 shows the linear model is approximately 71% accurate in predicting mpg of the MechaCar. Without considering other factors, the linear model does seem to be reliable.  


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The variance at the total summary level is approximately 62 psi, meeting the design specification requirement of remaining under 100 psi.

Looking at the lot_summary_df image below, Lot 3 does not meet the design specification with a psi of approximately 170 falling significantly above the 100 psi requirement.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

The T-test results across all manufacturing lots shows a p-value of 0.06028 which indicates they are not statistically different from the population mean.

The T-test on each individual lot shows p-values of:


Lot 1: 1
Lot 2: 0.6072
Lot 3: 0.04168

These results show Lot 1 and Lot 2 are not statistically different from the population mean. However, Lot 3 is slightly statistically different from the population mean. Lot 3 appears to be under-performing and should be further analyzed to determine if it should be dropped.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

With the surging cost of fuel, consumers are particularly interested in a vehicles fuel efficiency. A study should be performed to quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition in terms of fuel efficiency. The following are highlights of the study:


 1. Metric to be tested: Fuel efficiency- city and highway

 2. Null hypothesis: MechaCar's fuel efficiency is similar to the fuel efficiency of competitors vehicles within a similar class.
 
    Alternative hypothesis: MechaCar's fuel efficiency is statistically different in comparison to the fuel efficiency of competitors vehicles within a similar class

 3. Statistical test to be used: The T-test is the most appropriate statistical method to use in this study
 
 4. Data needed to run the test: Competitor fuel efficiency data for vehicles of a similar class to the MechaCar
